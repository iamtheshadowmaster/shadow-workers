## Why This Matters

**Slack/Teams:** Message-first chaos
- Everything is chronological conversation
- Tasks get buried in threads
- No persistent structure
- Bolt-on integrations that break

**Shadow:** Work-first clarity
- Tasks and notes are first-class citizens
- Conversations support work, don't bury it
- AI built into everything
- Structure emerges automatically

The result: What you'd get if Slack's collaboration, Notion's structure, and Trello's task management had an AI-powered baby.
