# Shadow — Brand Script V1
*Landing Page Copy based on StoryBrand Framework*

---

## 1. THE HERO (A Character)
**The customer is the hero, not our brand.**

### Who is the Hero?
**Professionals who build and sell software** — product managers, engineers, engineering managers, sales teams, as well as founders and investors — **that are responsible for hitting ambitious quarterly goals.**

### What Do They Want?
**They want to consistently crush their ambitious quarterly goals  without drowning in chaos.**

The hero wants:
- To focus on what truly moves the needle (conserving time)
- To prove they're delivering results (gaining status)
- To outperform their competition individually and as a team (winning)
- To experience that rare team chemistry that makes them feel unstoppable (championship feeling)
- To feel in control, not reactive (desiring meaning)
- To feel people love working with them (showing generosity)

### Story Question
**"Can I crush my goals AND build a team that operates like champions"**

---

## 2. WITH A PROBLEM

### The Villain
**Endless distractions and misaligned priorities.**

The villain is:
- **Slack notifications, unnecessary meetings, and urgent-but-not-important tasks** that steal focus from strategic work
- **The tyranny of the urgent** that prevents the hero from working on what actually matters
- **Generic AI tools that require hours of prompt engineering and GPT building** just to maybe help you
- **Root cause**: The inability to distinguish signal from noise in a sea of information
- **Relatable**: Every manager knows the pain of a day filled with meetings but zero progress
- **Singular**: It's not "bad tools" or "lack of time"—it's misalignment between daily work and strategic goals
- **Real**: 60% of a manager's time is spent in meetings, but only 20% of those meetings drive real progress

**The irony?** You tried ChatGPT. You spent 2 hours building a "custom GPT" for project management. Your team never used it. It sits there, another abandoned tool.

### External Problem
**"I can't keep track of everything. I'm constantly context-switching between tools, meetings, and priorities."**

Sales Manager: "I have 47 deals in my pipeline. Which ones should I actually focus on?"
Product Manager: "I'm juggling 5 features across 3 teams. What should I ship first?"
Engineering Manager: "My team has 83 open PRs. How do I unblock the right ones?"

**And worse:**
"My team is equally lost. We're misaligned. Everyone's working hard, but we're not pulling in the same direction."

### Internal Problem
**"I feel like I'm failing."**

- Sales Manager: "I'm working 60-hour weeks but still behind on quota. Am I a bad leader?"
- Product Manager: "Engineering is frustrated with me because specs keep changing. I can't get alignment."
- Engineering Manager: "My team is burning out and I don't know how to protect their time without looking like I'm making excuses."

**And the guilt:**
"If I can't lead myself, how can I lead my team? They deserve better."

**The external problem makes the hero feel overwhelmed, reactive, and ineffective.**

### Philosophical Problem
**"My work should feel intentional, not reactive. I deserve to lead strategically, not just firefight."**

The hero believes:
- Leaders should spend their time on high-leverage activities, not administrative busywork
- Teams perform best when they have clarity, not chaos
- Success should be measurable and visible, not a guess
- The right tools should amplify human judgment, not replace it
- **AI should work for you from day one—not require a PhD in prompt engineering**

**People want to be engaged in a story bigger than themselves.**
This isn't just about "productivity." It's about **reclaiming agency** in a world designed to distract you—and helping your team do the same.

## 3. MEETS A GUIDE (Who Gives Empathy + Competency)

**We are not the hero. We are the guide.**

### Empathy: "We feel your pain."
We've built Shadow because we've lived this.

- "You're in back-to-back meetings but your OKR progress is at 15% with 2 weeks left in the quarter. We get it."
- "You spend Sunday nights catching up on work you couldn't finish during the week. We've been there."
- "Your team is asking for clarity, but you're still figuring it out yourself. That's real."
- "You tried ChatGPT. You built a custom GPT. Your team never used it. We know."

**Common language**: We speak in OKRs, pipelines, cycle time, activation rates—your world, not generic "productivity."

**Why Shadow is different:**
Shadow is not a generic AI that requires configuration. It's purpose-built for one thing: **making you and your team hit your targets.** From minute 1, it just works.

## 4. WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN

**"Here's exactly how to go from chaos to clarity."**

### Pre-Sales Plan (3 Simple Steps)

**Step 1: Tell Shadow your biggest goal**
→ Answer 6 questions in a 3-minute chat. No forms. No GPT building. Just talk.

**Step 2: Shadow builds your Strategic Map**
→ OKRs, prioritized tasks, and automations—instantly generated. It just works.

**Step 3: See the magic in action**
→ Free 14-day trial. No credit card. Invite your team anytime. Cancel anytime.

### Post-Sales Plan (How It Works After You Start)

**Step 1: Connect your tools (optional)**
→ Calendar, Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, Linear—whatever you use.

**Step 2: Chat with Shadow daily**
→ Turn conversations into tasks, automatically prioritized by OKR impact. Shadow learns your context—no prompt engineering required.

**Step 3: Invite your team (Team Player mode)**
→ Your team gets their own Shadow, aligned with your shared OKRs. Everyone pulls in the same direction.

**Step 4: Get weekly insights**
→ Shadow tells you and your team what's working, what's drifting, and what to fix.

**Step 5: Hit your goals, consistently**
→ Track progress in real-time. Celebrate wins together. Adjust fast.

### Alignment Plan (Overcoming Fear)

We know you might be thinking:

❓ *"Is this just another tool I won't use?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Shadow lives in chat (native, Slack or Teams)—no dashboards to check. It comes to you.

❓ *"Will this take forever to set up?"*
✅ **Agreement**: You'll have your first OKR and tasks in under 5 minutes. We promise.

❓ *"Isn't this just ChatGPT with extra steps?"*
✅ **Agreement**: No. ChatGPT requires hours of prompt engineering and custom GPT building. Shadow is purpose-built for OKRs and goals. It just works from minute 1.

❓ *"What if my data isn't safe?"*
✅ **Agreement**: SOC 2 certified. Your data is encrypted and never used to train our models.

❓ *"What if it doesn't understand my specific goals?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Shadow learns your context automatically. No configuration. No "builder mindset" required.

❓ *"What if my team won't adopt it?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Team Player mode = free onboarding for your team + Slack/Teams integrations so they don't need another login. They'll love it.

❓ *"Can I try it with just me first, then add my team?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Absolutely. Start solo. Invite your team whenever you're ready. Shadow scales with you.

## 6. THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE

**Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending.**

### What Are the Stakes?

**If you don't solve this problem, here's what happens:**

#### Sales Manager
- ❌ You miss quota again. Your boss questions your ability to lead.
- ❌ Your top performers leave because they don't trust your direction.
- ❌ You burn out trying to work harder, not smarter.
- ❌ Your team works in silos. Everyone's chasing different deals. No alignment.

**"You worked 70-hour weeks and still missed the number. Your team is scattered. Was it worth it?"**

#### Product Manager
- ❌ Engineering loses trust in you. They stop taking your roadmap seriously.
- ❌ You ship features nobody uses because you're guessing, not measuring.
- ❌ Your launch slips another quarter. Leadership replaces you.
- ❌ Your team doesn't know what "done" looks like. Everyone's building different things.

**"Another failed launch. Another retrospective where nothing changes. Your team is confused."**

#### Engineering Manager
- ❌ Your best devs quit because they're drowning in meetings and context-switching.
- ❌ Velocity plummets. Product blames you. You blame the team. Trust breaks.
- ❌ You become the bottleneck because you're too reactive to be strategic.
- ❌ Your team can't self-organize because they don't know what's most important.

**"Your team shipped half of what was promised. Again. They're lost. Now what?"**

### The Cost of Inaction

**What does it cost to NOT use Shadow?**

- **Time**: 12+ hours/week lost to misaligned priorities and reactive work
- **Money**: Missed revenue targets = lost bonuses, promotions, and credibility
- **Team**: Burned-out team members who leave for "better-managed" teams
- **Reputation**: You become known as the manager who can't deliver
- **Team chaos**: Your team working hard but not together—scattered, confused, demoralized

**Human beings are motivated by loss aversion.**

Ask yourself:
*"Can I afford another quarter like the last one? Can my team?"*
