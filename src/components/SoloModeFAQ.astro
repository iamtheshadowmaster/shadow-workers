  {
    question: "What's the difference between Freelance and Full-Time?",
    answer: "<strong>Freelance</strong> lets you hire a worker by the day ($80/day) or per mission (fixed quote upfront) — you only pay for what you use. <strong>Full-Time</strong> is a dedicated worker on your payroll at $500/month, always available, with unlimited tasks. Think of it like real hiring: freelance for flexibility, full-time for commitment."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between daily rate and per mission?",
    answer: "Two ways to hire freelance. <strong>Daily rate</strong> ($80/day) — book a worker for as many days as you need, no minimum. Great for recurring or ongoing work. <strong>Per mission</strong> — you define a brief, get a fixed quote upfront, and only pay on delivery. Perfect for one-off projects with clear deliverables."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the 14-day trial include?",
    answer: "Full-Time workers come with a <strong>14-day free trial</strong>. Your worker starts immediately with full access to all skills and integrations. If you're not satisfied after 14 days, you simply don't continue — no credit card required, no questions asked."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the satisfaction guarantee work?",
    answer: "Every Freelance contract — whether daily or per mission — is backed by a <strong>full money-back guarantee</strong>. If you're not happy with the work delivered, you get a complete refund. Zero risk on your end."
  },
  {
    question: "What are performance bonuses?",
    answer: "Full-Time workers earn bonuses tied to task completion milestones and quality metrics. It keeps your worker's incentives aligned with your goals — better output, better pay. Same principle as real-world performance incentives."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Department plan?",
    answer: "The Department plan lets you hire an <strong>entire team</strong> of Shadow Workers — across IT, HR, Sales, or any function. You get cross-worker collaboration, volume pricing, a dedicated account manager, SLA guarantees, and advanced security. Pricing is custom based on your team size."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I scale up or switch plans?",
    answer: "Yes. Start freelance to test the fit, then move to full-time when you need a dedicated worker. Scale back during quieter periods. Or go straight to a Department plan when you're ready for a full AI workforce. No lock-in, switch anytime."
