# Controlling idea
Story gap: you put a gap between your hero and what they want.

# A character
The customer is the hero, not our brand. It should be clear who the hero is, and what they want. Attention arises and lowers with the opening and the closing of story gaps. The customer need should be focused on one thing only.
Relevant desires to the customers survival: 
- conserving financial resources
- conserving time
- building social networks
- gaining status
- accumulating resources
- showing generosity
- desiring meaning

What is the story question we're asking to our customers?

# With a problem
## Villain
the villain gives the problem a root cause and a focus. For time management software, the villain could be time thieves = people that steal our time with useless meetings, etc... Could be slack for us.
The villain should be: 
- a root cause
- relatable
- singular
- real

## External problem
If we're a restaurant, the external problem we solve is hunger. It should be obvious.
Companies tend to sell a solution to external problems, but really they need to solve internal problems.

## Internal problem
The internal problem is how the external problem make our customers feel. What does this external problem make our customers feel? For instance if you have a house painting business, the exrternal problem is having an unsightly home. The internal problem would be "i'm embarrassed to have the ugliest house on the street"

## Philosophical problem
Adding philosophical problems creates depth and meaning in a story and is often the reason stories resonate and become fan favorites.The philosophical problem helps those who engage the story understand why the story matters in the overall epic narrative of humanity itself. People want to be engaged in a story bigger than themselves.

The perfect brand promise: if we really want to satisfy our customers and create brand evangelists, we should resolve external, internal and philosophical problems altogether. 

Example with Tesla: 
- Villain: Gas-guzzling, inferior tech
- External: I need a better car
- Internal: i want to be an early adopter of nex tech
- Philosophical: my choice of car ought to help save the environment and perform better at the same time

# Meets a guide
Customers are not looking fir another hero, they're looking for a guide. We are not the hero. We are the guide of the customer, who's the hero.
A guide has two characteristics: empathy and competency. 

## Empathy 
we feel your pain, we use the same language, common experience

## Competency 
we've done it before, we need to be very effective in our line of work, and admit we're not in other lines. 5 ways of showing competency: 
- testimonials
- statistics
- awards
- press mentions
- logos

# Who gives them a plan
How do I get from where I am to the place where I've adoptedthis new product in my life. 
Should be simple steps to follow to solve the customers problem.
The plan encourages the customer to move forward. Two plans: 

## Pre-sales plan:
schedule an appointment
allow us to create a customozed plan
let's execute on this plan

## Post sales plan: 
download the software
integrate your database
revolutionize customer interaction

You can also combine presales and post sales:
- test drive a car
- purchase the car
- enjoy free maintenance for life

Alignement plan: list of agreements made with a customer to help them overcome their fear of doing business with you. Best way to come up with agrrement plan is to list all things your customer might be concerned about as it relates to your product or service and then counter that list with agreements that will alleviate those concerns.

And calls them to action

Customers dont take action unless you ask them to. 

Ask them to place an order now in simple language.  Ask multiple times.

# That helps them avoid failure
Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending
What's there to lose for your customer? I should know what are the stakes if I dont by the product. Human beings are motivated by loss aversion. Fear is the salt in the recipe.We should not let a fear of negative messageing keep us from using it.  What are you helping your customer avoid?
And ends in a success
Identity Transformation

# One liner
A one-liner is a better version to answer the question "What do you do?"
What makes these tag lines complete and effective? Two things: clarity and promise. 
Example for movies: 
- "Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentruc pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead." - ¨Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
Our one-liner should be like a logline for a movie. 
our one-liner will make people want to buy our product. And it will be used to convert all our employees in sales team.
The one-liner should be so clear that when anyone asks to any employee what we do, they can explain it in such a clear way customers clearly understand why they need our product.
To create an effective one-line, use sound-bites from our brandscript. 
The one-liner has 3 parts: the problem, the product as solution, and the result. 
It does not have to be one sentence, nor more than 4 sentences. It's a statement. Who is your customer? What is their problem? What is your plan to help them? What will their life look like after you do?

# Landing page structure
## Header
The job of the header is to explain your offer so clearly and in such simple language that your customers wants to know more. 

## The stakes
Where you put the negative consequences of not doing business with you.

## Value proposition
Since stakes is negative, let's go positive (humans like negative / positive swings)
Wordier version of the header

## Guide
Now you have earned the right to be heard. Position yourself as the guide the hero needs in order to solve their problem. Communicate empathy and competency.

## Plan
At this point, many customers might want to make an order but they are not going to because of cognitive dissonance. Something still feels confusing. They wonder how the process is going to work. 

## The explanatory paragraph
Customers often want to do their due diligence before placing an order. Give them a fex paragraphs to read.
