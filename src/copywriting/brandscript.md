# Shadow — Brand Script V1
*Landing Page Copy based on StoryBrand Framework*

---

## 1. THE HERO (A Character)
**The customer is the hero, not our brand.**

### Who is the Hero?
**Professionals who build and sell software** — product managers, engineers, engineering managers, sales teams, as well as founders and investors — **that are responsible for hitting ambitious quarterly goals.**

### What Do They Want?
**They want to consistently crush their ambitious quarterly goals  without drowning in chaos.**

The hero wants:
- To focus on what truly moves the needle (conserving time)
- To prove they're delivering results (gaining status)
- To outperform their competition individually and as a team (winning)
- To experience that rare team chemistry that makes them feel unstoppable (championship feeling)
- To feel in control, not reactive (desiring meaning)
- To feel people love working with them (showing generosity)

### Story Question
**"Can I crush my goals AND build a team that operates like champions"**

---

## 2. WITH A PROBLEM

### The Villain
**The constant flood of tasks, messages, and fires that keeps you running in circles, always busy and never winning**


### External Problem
**"We get ambitious targets and we almost never hit them. Or the pain to get there destroys us."**

The brutal cycle:
- Q1: "Hit 150% of last quarter"
- End of Q1: Hit 87%. Burnout half the team.
- Q2: "Hit 150% again"
- Repeat.

**The pattern:**
Either we miss the target and feel like failures, or we hit it and everyone's destroyed. There's no winning.

### Internal Problem
**"Why do other teams make this look easy while we're drowning?"**

The spiral of blame:
- **"Is it me?"** Maybe I'm just not good enough at this.
- **"Is it my team?"** Maybe I need to fire people and start over.
- **"Is it management?"** Maybe they're setting us up to fail.
- **"Why are we losing?"** We're talented. We work hard. But we keep missing. Like a sports team that doesn't know why they're losing.

**The comparison that kills you:**
"New AI companies are crushing it. Competitors are shipping faster. We're supposed to be good—but we're getting left behind."

### Philosophical Problem
**"Reaching ambitious targets shouldn't require destroying yourself. Success should be possible without the pain."**

What the hero believes:
- **Ambition is good**—but it shouldn't cost your mental health
- **With all the tools and knowledge we have, success should be easier**—not harder
- **Success and suffering aren't the same thing**—you can win without burning out
- **Great teams make it look effortless**—they're not working harder, they're working clearer
- **Pain and success shouldn't be inseparable**—the grind shouldn't be the point

**People want to be engaged in a story bigger than themselves.**

This isn't about lowering your standards. It's about proving that **ambitious targets CAN be hit without destroying your team**—that success can be intentional, sustainable, and even enjoyable when everyone knows what they're chasing together.

## 3. MEETS A GUIDE (Who Gives Empathy + Competency)

**We are not the hero. We are the guide.**

### Empathy: "We've lived your pain."

We built Shadow because **we know what it feels like.**

#### We've been the sales rep drowning in quota pressure.
You're at 65% of target with two weeks left. Your pipeline looks healthy but nothing's closing. You're working weekends, taking calls at midnight, and still hearing "maybe next quarter."

**We've been there.** Leading sales for an AI product line, constantly fighting to hit the number while the product kept breaking underneath us.

#### We've been the product manager crushed between teams.
Engineering says "that's impossible." Sales already sold it. The CEO wants a report on why it's taking so long. You're juggling roadmaps, sprint planning, and damage control—and nobody's happy.

**We've been there.** Managing products where we had responsibility but no authority, trying to keep everyone aligned while the ground shifted under our feet.

#### We've been the engineering manager watching the team burn out.
Your best developers are working 70-hour weeks trying to fix what should never have been built. Morale is tanking. People are quitting. You're stuck between "ship it" and "do it right."

**We've been there.** Leading 30 engineers through chaos, trying to protect their time while delivering on impossible commitments.

---

**The pattern we saw everywhere:**

Sales, Product, and Engineering all grinding hard, but never fully aligned. Everyone's trying to win, but the team chemistry is broken.

At some point, we thought: *"Maybe it's us. Maybe we're just not good enough."*

Then we realized: **It wasn't us. It was the lack of alignment.**

When teams don't have a shared truth about what matters most, doubt creeps in. Burnout follows. Targets get missed.

**That's why we built Shadow.**

Not to make individuals superhuman. To give teams the **alignment** they need to win together—without destroying themselves in the process.

---

**We speak your language:**

We don't talk about "productivity hacks." We talk about:
- **OKRs at 23% with 2 weeks left**
- **Pipeline coverage dropping below 3x**
- **Cycle time creeping from 5 days to 14**
- **Activation rates stuck at 40%**
- **Sprint commitments missed 3 quarters in a row**

We've lived in your Slack channels. We've been in your standups. We've written your postmortems.

**Shadow is purpose-built** for one thing: making you and your team hit your targets. From minute 1, it just works.

---

### Competency: "We've solved this before and we know how to solve it again."

We're not just empathetic. **We're effective.**

#### We've shipped AI products used by millions.
- 10 years working on AI (before it was trendy)
- Built and sold an AI company (Vizir → LumApps)
- Led AI product lines from $1M → $10M ARR
- Managed 30+ engineers through chaos and still delivered

#### We thrived in dysfunction—and learned what works.
Most companies fail because of:
1. **Misalignment** (sales selling what product can't build)
2. **Distraction** (CEOs asking for reports instead of results)
3. **No accountability** (managers promoted for tenure, not competence)

We survived all of this. **And we figured out the antidote:**

✅ **Radical alignment** (everyone knows what matters)
✅ **Clarity over chaos** (one shared source of truth)
✅ **Team chemistry** (tools that make collaboration effortless)

That's what Shadow does. **It creates the team alchemy we wish we'd had.**

## 4. WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN

**"Here's exactly how to go from chaos to clarity."**

### Pre-Sales Plan

**Step 1: Sign up and answer 2 questions**
→ "What's your role?" "What's your biggest goal this quarter?" That's it. 90 seconds.

**Step 2: Get your personal user prompt — Magic moment 1**
→ Shadow instantly shows you the deep context it gathered and the personalized instructions it built for you.

**Step 3: Configure your daily check-ins**
Connect Shadow to Slack/Teams so it can reach you where you work.

---

### Post-Sales Plan

**Step 1: You get unique insights about what you should do**
Shadow reaches out with a unique insight that you wouldn't have thought of yourself.

**Step 2: Shadow starts the job for you**
When opening your first daily check-in, you see that Shadow doesn't just say "do this task." but says: "I've already started the task for you to review"

**Step 3 : You become measurably more effective** (Day 2-3)
→ Within 3 days max, you feel the difference:
  - You're shipping high-impact work faster
  - Your decisions are clearer (Shadow shows you what moves the needle)
  - You have time back (Shadow handles the busywork)
→ **Next step:** Invite your team (they get the same magic, instantly aligned) or connect more tools (Shadow gets even smarter).
→ **The proof:** You're hitting goals, not just checking boxes.

---

### What Makes Shadow Outstanding (Features)

**Shadow is purpose-built for one thing: helping you and your team hit your goals. Here's what makes it special:**

#### 1. Agentic Context Retrieval
**You say one sentence. Shadow captures everything.**

Every message you send triggers intelligent agents that analyze your prompt and gather extensive context:
- **Example:** "I'm a PM at a B2B SaaS company" → Shadow automatically researches your industry, pulls common PM challenges, identifies typical KPIs, and understands your success metrics
- **Powered by agents** — Not simple keyword matching. Shadow runs background agents to extract maximum context from minimal input
- **Multiple context sources:**
  - Your conversations (chat, notes, huddles)
  - Connected tools (Slack, Notion, Calendar, GitHub, Google Drive, etc.)
  - Shadow's native work features (tasks, notes, group chat)
- **Stored in memory** — Everything Shadow learns is saved permanently using advanced memory systems

**The magic:** Other AI needs prompt engineering. Shadow just works.

---

#### 2. Personal Operating System
**Shadow builds a living "system prompt" that knows exactly who you are and what you're trying to achieve.**

- **User System Prompt (for individuals)**
  - Shadow creates a personalized AI prompt that captures: your role, goals, working style, constraints, priorities, and success criteria
  - Updates automatically as you work and chat
  - Always active — every conversation starts with Shadow knowing your full context
  - **Result:** You can make objective decisions based on what you *should* do, not what feels urgent

- **Team System Prompt (for teams)**
  - Shared context across your entire team
  - Everyone's Shadow is aligned to the same goals, priorities, and definitions of success
  - When you update OKRs, everyone's system prompt updates automatically
  - **Result:** Your team operates with perfect alignment. Zero miscommunication.

**The magic:** Shadow becomes your external brain — and for teams, it's a shared brain that keeps everyone aligned.

---

#### 3. Task Management & Prioritization
**Shadow builds and prioritizes your work automatically.**

- **Creates tasks from everything**
  - Extracts action items from conversations, meetings, notes, and connected tools
  - Adds them to your to-do list automatically — no manual entry required

- **Prioritizes by goal impact**
  - Every task is ranked by how much it moves your OKRs forward
  - You always know what to work on next — zero guessing, zero decision fatigue

- **Team coordination**
  - Team members see shared tasks and priorities
  - Everyone knows what matters most

**The magic:** Your to-do list builds itself and stays focused on what actually matters.

---

#### 4. Proactive Progress Tracking
**Most AI waits for you to ask. Shadow checks on you.**

Shadow actively tracks your progress and keeps you moving forward:
- **Daily summaries** — "Here's what you accomplished today. Here's what's next."
- **Progress check-ins** — "You're at 67% on your activation goal. Here's what's blocking you."
- **Proactive messages** — "You said you'd review the PRD by Friday. Still on track?"
- **Team insights** — "Your team is ahead on Feature X but behind on Y. Here's why."

**The magic:** Shadow is your accountability partner. It doesn't let you (or your team) drift off course.

---

#### 5. Autopilot for Routine Work
**Shadow doesn't just track work — it does some of it for you.**

Shadow can execute tasks on autopilot:
- Draft emails, reports, and updates
- Pull data and build summaries
- Schedule meetings and send reminders
- Update spreadsheets and dashboards
- Start research and prepare briefs

**The more context Shadow has (from tools, conversations, and work), the more it can automate.**

**The magic:** Shadow frees you from busywork so you can focus on high-impact decisions.

---

### Alignment Plan (Overcoming Fear)

We know you might be thinking:

❓ *"Is this just another tool I won't use?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Shadow lives where you work—native app, Slack, or Teams. No dashboards to check. It comes to you with daily check-ins and proactive insights.

❓ *"Will this take forever to set up?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Answer 2 questions (role + biggest goal). Shadow does the rest. You'll have your personalized system prompt and first insights in under 90 seconds.

❓ *"Isn't this just another generic AI with extra steps?"*
✅ **Agreement**: No. Generic AI (ChatGPT, Claude) requires hours of prompt engineering every time you use it. Shadow is purpose-built for goals and teams. Your context persists. Zero configuration. It just works from minute 1.
→ **See the difference**: [/blog/shadow-vs-chatgpt-okrs]

❓ *"What if my data isn't safe?"*
✅ **Agreement**: SOC 2 Type II certified. End-to-end encryption. Your data is never used to train models. You own your data, always.

❓ *"What if it doesn't understand my specific role or industry?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Shadow's agentic context retrieval automatically researches your industry, role, and common challenges. You say "I'm a PM at a B2B SaaS company"—Shadow pulls comprehensive context. No manual configuration needed.

❓ *"What if my team won't adopt it?"*
✅ **Agreement**:
- **Solo mode first**: Start alone, prove the value to yourself
- **Team mode when ready**: Invite your team—they inherit shared context and goals automatically
- **Slack/Teams integration**: They don't need another login. Shadow meets them where they work
- **4.2x faster onboarding**: When one manager uses Shadow, the whole team gets aligned instantly

❓ *"Can I try it with just me first, then add my team later?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Absolutely. That's the recommended path:
1. **Week 1**: Use Solo mode ([/solo]). Prove value to yourself.
2. **Week 2**: Invite your team ([/team]). Everyone gets aligned automatically.
3. **Week 3+**: Your team operates like a championship squad.
→ Shadow scales with you—from 1 person to 100+.

❓ *"What if I'm already hitting my goals? Do I need this?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Great teams use Shadow to go from "hitting goals while burning out" to "hitting goals while staying sane." It's not about working harder—it's about working clearer.
→ **Read**: [/blog/hit-quarterly-goals-without-burnout]

❓ *"How is this different from just using general purpose AI with a good prompt?"*
✅ **Agreement**:
- General AI: You write the same context every time. No memory. No proactive support.
- Shadow: Your context is stored permanently. Shadow checks on you. It starts tasks for you. It remembers everything.
→ **See full comparison**: [/blog/shadow-vs-chatgpt-okrs]

❓ *"What if I've never used OKRs before?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Perfect. Shadow doesn't require you to be an OKR expert. Just tell Shadow your biggest goal. Shadow translates it into a trackable objective and helps you break it into key results.
→ **Learn**: [/blog/three-okr-mistakes-killing-focus]

❓ *"What if I don't want to connect all my tools?"*
✅ **Agreement**: You don't have to. Shadow works with zero integrations. But every tool you connect makes Shadow smarter. Start with just chat. Add tools when you're ready.

❓ *"I'm a founder/engineer/PM sales rep—is this for me?"*
✅ **Agreement**: Yes. Shadow adapts to your role:
- **Founders**: [/founders] — Strategic clarity, investor updates, team alignment
- **Engineers**: [/engineers] — Focus time, PR reviews, sprint planning
- **Product Managers**: [/product-managers] — Roadmap prioritization, stakeholder alignment
- **Sales Teams**: [/sales] — Pipeline focus, deal prioritization, quota attainment
- **Investors**: [/investors] — Portfolio tracking, founder support

---

**Bottom line**: Shadow removes every excuse that keeps you from hitting your goals—and helps your team do the same.

## 6. THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE

**Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending.**

### What Are the Stakes?

**If you don't solve this problem, here's what happens:**

#### Sales Manager
- ❌ You miss quota again. Your boss questions your ability to lead.
- ❌ Your top performers leave because they don't trust your direction.
- ❌ You burn out trying to work harder, not smarter.
- ❌ Your team works in silos. Everyone's chasing different deals. No alignment.

**"You worked 70-hour weeks and still missed the number. Your team is scattered. Was it worth it?"**

#### Product Manager
- ❌ Engineering loses trust in you. They stop taking your roadmap seriously.
- ❌ You ship features nobody uses because you're guessing, not measuring.
- ❌ Your launch slips another quarter. Leadership replaces you.
- ❌ Your team doesn't know what "done" looks like. Everyone's building different things.

**"Another failed launch. Another retrospective where nothing changes. Your team is confused."**

#### Engineering Manager
- ❌ Your best devs quit because they're drowning in meetings and context-switching.
- ❌ Velocity plummets. Product blames you. You blame the team. Trust breaks.
- ❌ You become the bottleneck because you're too reactive to be strategic.
- ❌ Your team can't self-organize because they don't know what's most important.

**"Your team shipped half of what was promised. Again. They're lost. Now what?"**

### The Cost of Inaction

**What does it cost to NOT use Shadow?**

- **Time**: 12+ hours/week lost to misaligned priorities and reactive work
- **Money**: Missed revenue targets = lost bonuses, promotions, and credibility
- **Team**: Burned-out team members who leave for "better-managed" teams
- **Reputation**: You become known as the manager who can't deliver
- **Team chaos**: Your team working hard but not together—scattered, confused, demoralized

**Human beings are motivated by loss aversion.**

Ask yourself:
*"Can I afford another quarter like the last one? Can my team?"*
