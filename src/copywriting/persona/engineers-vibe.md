# Engineers

First it's not only engineering managers I'm targetting, but let's say experienced engineers, lead engineers, engineering managers. all but junior engineers really. 

So what are engineering aspirations / fears ? 

With AI coding, it's getting crazy. 

There are two camps, the ones that believe it's shit and it's better to code by hand. This camp will die eventually. How can they explain to their management that they are not into it ? 

And the camp of those who are convinced that AI coding is changing their jobs, and they need to get on top of it. With multiple concerns: 
- will it work for my real company, with huge codebase, huge user base, with a need to be production ready, with a high quality standard, etc...
- there are new stuff going out eeryday, how do I stay on top? how do i even choose the best setup? I have no time to learn while working, need to do this in my spare time. 
- my management is pushiung me to adopt these, but they don't understand shit about it. They just ear "engineer are useless now"
- non technical people start showing me live demo of stuf they've built on lovable or bolt or some shit like this, and they expect us to do this is no time. I've got more pressure to deliver fast than ever. It's harder for me to be defensive on developing timelines. I feel like we're probably shipping shit and building technical debt
- for a manager: some of my engineers are so far away from thi sAI stuff, they don't even eer tried those... how do i lead with it, get them onboard without scraing them
- i see all those crazy jobs in Ai startups, should I apply ? 

Apart from that, my nightmare is usually that PMs change direction every week or so lol
In the end, sales leader are the ones who decide what to ship, and my nightmare is to have my CTO pinging me on slack saying "dude you need to ship this by next week or you're fired". So i feel i'm constantly shipping features in emergency mode, without having a proper direction. 

Specs from PM/POs are so shit. I'm torn about either debating in calls untl we get them good, or just avoid it and just build what i understood. 

Processes internaly are a nightmare, and we have no time improving them. PRs get stuck for a long time, and it's hard for me to switch topics. I don't get a clear view of what i should do next. 

As a manager, i'm constantly stuck in reorganizations, filling gaps in this or that team.
