let's work on the founder copy now. 

so founders job (i'm a founder myself) is so complex.

there are so ma,ny types of startups stages, industries (consumer / B2B / ...) and financing strategies (VCs, bootstraped...) that it's probably impossible to map this all out. 

but in the guts, from a founder that built and sold a bootstrapped company, and worked at the board of a unicorn, here's what i can tell about founder's role. 

for aspirations and fears. well, aspirations vary a lot, and get be deeply rooted in the psychology of the founder it self. They want to prove people wrong, or prove that they are better than their father or sibblings or ex coworkers etc..., or they're crazy enough to want to change the world in some way, or they just want to craf their own tool and company, geek out on the product, some just want to make money (a lot), and some just like the drenaline of it. 

the main thing is that they feel they have something to bring to the world, but they always doubt if this thing is really people want or not. They feel like it does, but they're never sure. They spend countless hours refining their pitch, sharing it with people, getting harsh feedback, being able to detach from the feedback, do not take it personally and adapt their pitch and product from feedback, iterate super fast etc...

they usually know (except the junior ones) that's a long ride (10 years). and that there is very little chance of succeeding (whatever success means for them). 

what they like mostly if do things. build stuff. and work with passionate people, better than them in specific fields. 

once they have found some kinf of product market fit, then the doubt is still there but less violent, they want at all cost to grow fast without making any error that would kill their precious baby (recruiting bad, raising too much, ...). 

they usually lack of ambition as well, mostly true for first time founders. Aiming big is crucial. Succeeding a big ambition is not more complicated than a small one. 

they can be lost in useless work. Mostly when you are a founder good at building, you can just keep your head down and geek out. build a website, improve your product, etc... and make actual work that does not drive you faster to success or failure. 

when you get an idea, the goal is to go as fast as possible to success or failure. then either push or pivot. 

so the main job is to go and reach out for potential customers, pitch the idea, with whatever is it you have really as a product, and close your first deal. And your first 10 deals, and so on. 

the only metric that matter at the beginning is the revenue you are able to generate. 

when working with a team, it's hard to share this doubt burden. Founders usualy thrive under stress and pressure and doubt. But not every foudners and employee is. 

so the goal is to get your message clear, share it, see if it sells or not. repeat. 

all the work to be done can be overwhelming (getting customers, building product, getting feedback, financing the project, recruiting, managing ops, etc...). So it's hard to keep priorities. 

then when the team grows you need to act as a leader. be able to go as fast as possible to success or failure with recruiting as well. hire fast, fire fast.

the ambition level is now bigger than ever with companies that go from 0 ARR to 100 ARR in under a year. peer pressure is crazy. no one really knows how to achieve that. so doubt can be overwhelming even more. 

the goal of a founder is also to increase the creation of opportunities. Generate opportunities of recruiting, selling, financing,... as much as possible and then take the right oppies when you need. it's like generating a pipeline of opportunities all around. 

take this raw material and structure the copy for the founders.
