# Investors. 

Here are here targetting pre-seed, seed and series A investors in software companies. 

We've done 10+ interviews with VCs and here are their jobs. 

Their fears and aspirations. 

first their main goal is to raise money from wealthy people, and 7 to 10 years later, provide a solid ROI (x3 is good, check for other standards online if needed). 

their reputation is always at stake. if they fail a fund, they'd rather find another line of business. this is whta they fear deeply (ending a fund with no returns). 

so now onto decomposing the job. 
first they need to raise money. to raise money they need to have an extensive network and a track record. they need to know who to pitch. they need to have a specific thesis on the market and show competency (successfull entrereneurial adventure, backed unicorns as an angel, ...). and they need to explein it clearly. then they need to book the targeted amount in a short amount of time (6 months max). 

once they have the money, they start deploying it. the first skill is to know the entrepreneurial market (sourcing) they shall talk to any founder in their thesis. and judge him or her based on what they are working for. they judge first by the team. as long as the team is rock solid, the idea can change along the way. founders that have sold their first startup are golden. repeat founders also. first time foudners with outstanding academic or business background (worked at meta, google, ...) are also interesting. Then there's the idea and the market. VCs are chasing companies able to do 10 to 100x. The main goal is to drive them as fast as possible to the next round, with the bigger valuation possible, sell some of their position (if not all) and repeat. So market size is important. They also need to compete with other funds on the best startups. 

they need to understand the AI space currently happening. Is it a bubble? Is there money to make? 

sometimes they "incubate" or root early teams to get them to the right place. 
also sometimes they are super hands on, finding customers, opening their networks etc... in order to get the startup to the next round. it really depends on the fund strategy (some have less investments, more important, with hands on strategy, some are just spreading small amount of money and hope for return). 
depending on this the job to be done varies. 

what i expect from a fund as a founder, is to take care of the whole financing shit. how much should I raise, what valuation, and what targets of ARR do you need me to reach in which timeframe. 

and then I expect as much help as possible commercialy. everything else is bullshit really.

well back to their jobs. once they've invested in startups, they sit at boards, and usually give useless advices. for most of them. good investors give helpful ones, and really help in the end. 

then they need to do some report on their portfolio to their LP (every month or quartter). 

then when the fund advances in time, they need to make sure they deal with exiting the companies in the best way possible (next round at higher valuation, refunding the company, killing it, selling it). which is a lot of work. legaly and business wise.
