# Product managers

Let's say your are a top 1% product manager in the best startups (cursor, lovable, you name it). 

What are the 4 things you need to be outstanding at, your aspirations really?

Prioritization is one probably. Aligning engineering as well. 

Aligning sales rep is one, making usre they don't oversell, enable them as much as possible, drive sales

A PM in the end is a kind of CEO of his own line

He needs to own vision, engineering, sales / revenue, deployment (adoption)

He needs to be at the cutting edge of whta happens on his market, have a clear vision of where to go, and then execute that with scarce resources usually. 

He's kind of the chef d'orchestre. 

He also needs to keep his management happy, never say no frontaly to sales leaders and founders, but avoid altogether agressive sales that include engineering commits. How to do that when a sales says "if you ship those 3 features we get a 1M cARR contract, so just ship it dipshit"

So there is also some anticipation required

He also needs to identify product gaps and build solutions for these, even if they are not innovations, and therefore do not satisfy management lol. Board prefer a PM that ship a fucking AI feature, than one that just improves the current product (not AI).
