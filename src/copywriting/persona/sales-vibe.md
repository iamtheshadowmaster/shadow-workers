# Sales

So they are not just sales managers, but sales leaders, account executive (hunters), account managers (farmers). Avoid all SDR and junior roles. 

Aspirations and fears for sales professionals. 
the worst one is to close 0$ in a quarter. it happens more than you could think...
when you do one or two l ike that, you're fired. 
when you're under 50% quota consistently, you're fired. 

Sales need to work internally to make sure they have or build consistent pipeline. Not just reacting like "shit no leads this quarter, need to phone call or whatever". Then next quarter "i'm full of deals, i can't build pipeline". Classic issue. No matter how the organization is structured, sales need to make sure quality pipeline stays consistent and is aligned with their objectives. Working with marketing is usually a good thing, that no one does cause sales despise marketing folks lol. 

They need to make sure they pitch perfectly the product, which is hard in software because there are usually many features, it's ambiguous etc... So they need a really good understanding of their product and of their competitors They also need to adapt their pitch to the people they are talking to. With products that are usually multiforms, they need to handpick a small set of feature to present to a specific individual. They also need to adapt the way they pitch to the people. If they pitch a CIO, no bullshit, technical wordings. If they pitch to a marketing leader, no technical shit, pure value.

They need to understand their products, so learning internal documentation, asking for help, assisting enabements, and so on. 

They need to be very rigorous on CRM management. Making sure every meeting notes are logged, easily readable by their managers and by themselves so they can always answer the status of each deal. 

They need to be predictable (commit / best case pipeline). this commiting system is an art by itself. You need to commit at a certain level of certainty, which is a gut feeling really. Or experience lol. You can't commit deal that are already almost signe, it's too easy. You need to commit them when you feel / you have enough signs they are gonna sign. 

They need to understand the purchase process of the customer, and act like an enabler to make sure it's easy for them to buy, easier than with another vendor. 

For this, they need to be well connected internally to be able to activate the right person at the right moment, coach them, to make the deal progress. Being a product manager, an engineering manager, infosec team, solution engineers, the professional service team, a customer referal, the legal team, etc... they are some kind of a project manager for complex deals. So they also need to know internal processes as well. 

For account managers, they need to be super strategic to be able to continuously upsell their customers without looking like assholes. act like a smooth operator.
