*(Scroll-triggered word highlighting zone)*

### Headline
**Or you could just keep doing what you're doing**

### Scrolling Content
You know, keep **wasting time on work that doesn't matter**, slowly **falling behind competitors** who figured this out months ago, watching your **best people leave** for teams that actually have their act together, while your team quietly **loses faith** that you know where you're taking them.

## 3. The Plan - Solo Mode

### Headline
**Here's how it works for you**

### Step 1: We get your context
Tell us your role and your biggest goal. 3-minute conversation. That's it.

### Step 2: We build your OKR
Shadow creates your strategic map instantly. OKRs, tasks, priorities—all generated.

### Step 3: We keep you on track
Daily check-ins. Weekly insights. Shadow makes sure you're moving toward what matters.

### Step 4: Connect your tools for more power
Slack, Calendar, GitHub, Salesforce, Linear—whatever you use. Shadow gets smarter.

## 4. The Plan - Team Mode

### Headline
**Invite your team, multiply the impact**

### How Team Mode Works

**Step 1: You onboard first**
Get Shadow working for you. See the value yourself.

**Step 2: Invite your team**
Everyone gets Shadow—automatically configured with your shared OKRs.

**Step 3: Everyone knows what matters**
Zero "What should I prioritize?" questions. Your team self-organizes around impact.

**Step 4: You lead, they execute**
Perfect alignment. No micromanaging. Just results.

### The Result
One manager onboards. Whole team gets aligned.

**Sales team?** Everyone knows which deals matter.
**Product squad?** Everyone pulls toward the same launch.
**Dev team?** Everyone knows what's critical.

### CTA
**Get your team aligned**
