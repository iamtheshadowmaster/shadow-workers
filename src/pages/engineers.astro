          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            You're coding in emergency mode. Sales needs "one quick feature" for a million-dollar deal. Your CTO pings you on Slack: "Ship this by next week or we're screwed." Management keeps asking why you can't build as fast as someone using Bolt or Lovable. And every week there's a new AI coding tool you're supposed to evaluate while somehow staying productive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow becomes your engineering copilot with <strong>agentic context retrieval</strong>—you tell it your biggest delivery challenge in plain conversation, and Shadow automatically gathers context about your tech stack, team velocity, and production constraints. No forms, no configuration. It connects to GitHub, Jira, Slack, and calendar to understand your real world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow builds a <strong>personal operating system</strong> that knows your role, goals, and constraints. When management pushes unrealistic timelines, you have data on complexity and dependencies to propose better solutions. When priorities shift again, Shadow maintains context across sprints so you're not rebuilding mental models every week. When AI tools drop daily, Shadow cuts through the hype and shows you what works for your quality bar.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            With <strong>task management and prioritization</strong>, Shadow turns conversations into tasks automatically ranked by what actually ships quality work. <strong>Proactive tracking</strong> means Shadow checks on you—"You said you'd review that PR by Friday. Still on track?"—so nothing falls through the cracks. And with <strong>autopilot</strong>, Shadow drafts updates, pulls data, and handles busywork so you focus on high-impact decisions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The result? You become the facilitator who says yes with the right scope and speed. You ship quality under pressure. You join customer calls with context. You drive what gets built instead of just executing unclear specs. You're not just coding—you're enabling revenue.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
            You're an engineer in 2026. Shadow helps you stay that way.
