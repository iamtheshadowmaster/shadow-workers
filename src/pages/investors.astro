            Your reputation is always at stake. Fail a fund and you're finding another line of business. The job is simple in theory: raise money from wealthy people, deploy it into startups that can 10-100x, and deliver solid returns (3x minimum, ideally much more) in 7-10 years. In practice, it's chaos—sourcing deals, competing with other funds, judging teams and markets at speed, supporting portfolio companies, managing exits, and reporting to LPs. All while navigating questions like: Is AI a bubble or the next platform shift? Are we backing the right founders? Can we get them to the next round before they run out of cash?
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow becomes your investment operating system across the entire lifecycle. Before you deploy a dollar, you need to raise the fund. Shadow helps you track your network, identify who to pitch (based on LP fit, past investments, and relationship strength), refine your thesis, and articulate your track record clearly. Whether you sold a startup, backed unicorns as an angel, or have deep domain expertise, Shadow helps you communicate competency and close your target amount in 6 months or less.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Once you're deploying capital, Shadow connects to your network, tracks every founder in your thesis, and helps you evaluate teams, markets, and ideas at speed. Repeat founders? Sold their last company? Ex-Meta, ex-Google with a killer idea? Shadow surfaces the signals that matter. You judge teams first (rock-solid teams can pivot on ideas), then market size (can this 10-100x?), then competitive positioning. Shadow also tracks competing funds on hot deals so you know when to move fast and what terms win.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For portfolio monitoring, Shadow tracks metrics, team dynamics, and burn rate across every investment. You know which companies need attention before they ask. Key hire left? Momentum stalling? Runway tightening? Customer churn spiking? Shadow alerts you so you can intervene before struggles become crises. For board meetings, Shadow keeps context on what's actually happening at each company—so when you give advice, it's useful instead of generic VC platitudes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you're hands-on, Shadow helps you support founders where it actually matters—financing strategy (how much to raise, what valuation, what ARR targets in what timeframe) and commercial growth (opening your network, connecting them to customers, helping them close deals). Shadow tracks which portfolio companies need what support and when, so you're proactive instead of reactive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            As the fund matures, you need to manage exits—next round at higher valuation, secondary sale, acquisition, or wind-down. Shadow helps you track exit timing, legal complexity, buyer interest, and valuation scenarios. You know when to push for the next round, when to sell your position, when to refund, and when to cut losses. Every month or quarter, Shadow generates clear LP reports on portfolio performance without drowning in spreadsheets.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
            The deepest fear? Ending a fund with no returns. Shadow doesn't eliminate risk, but it gives you the intelligence, context, and speed to deploy capital wisely, support founders strategically, and deliver the returns your LPs expect. Your reputation depends on it.
