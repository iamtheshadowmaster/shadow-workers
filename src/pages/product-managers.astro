            You're conducting an orchestra with scarce resources, impossible demands, and competing agendas. Sales wants "just 3 features" for a $1M ARR deal. Management wants the sexy AI feature that looks good in board decks. Engineering needs you to prioritize tech debt. Users need unglamorous fixes that don't make headlines. And you need to say yes to everyone without actually saying yes to everyone.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow becomes your strategic command center. It connects your backlog, user data, sales pipeline, competitive intelligence, and market signals into one coherent view. When sales pushes for custom features, Shadow shows you whether this is a pattern worth building for or a one-off distraction. When management wants innovation, Shadow helps you balance shiny new features against the product gaps that actually block adoption.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For engineering alignment, Shadow maintains context across your roadmap so your team understands why priorities shift, what's truly blocking users, and how to push back on scope creep without losing trust. It surfaces blockers before standups and keeps specs current as decisions evolve—you're the conductor, not the bottleneck.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The real power? Anticipation. Shadow tracks your market, competitors, and emerging user patterns so you spot product gaps and opportunities before they become obvious. You can defend your vision with data, execute despite noise, and prove impact when you ship—whether it's an AI feature or an unglamorous fix that drives adoption.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
            You're the CEO of your product line. Shadow helps you act like it.
