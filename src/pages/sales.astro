          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            You're juggling pipeline building and deal closing simultaneously. Quarter starts strong but pipeline's thin, so you scramble. Mid-quarter you're drowning in demos and can't build for next quarter. End of quarter hits and you're empty again. Classic cycle. And if you close $0 two quarters in a row, you're gone.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow becomes your sales operating system. It connects to your CRM, email, calendar, and Slack to understand your deals, buyers, and pipeline in real-time. You can say "I'm at 67% quota with 3 weeks left" and Shadow pulls everything—current deal stages, buyer engagement levels, historical close patterns, pipeline coverage, what's committed vs. best case. No dashboard hunting. Shadow retrieves context automatically so you can focus on selling, not data entry.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow builds a living playbook that knows your quota, your territory, your product, your competitors, and your buyers. When you ask "Should I commit this deal?" Shadow already knows your commit history, the buyer's engagement signals, and what it typically takes to close in your segment. For daily execution, Shadow tracks every action item from calls and meetings—then shows you what actually moves deals. "Send security questionnaire to CIO" gets surfaced before "Update forecast notes" because Shadow knows which one unblocks the deal.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Shadow keeps you honest: "You said you'd follow up with the VP by Friday—still on track?" or "This deal has gone silent for 8 days, competitors might be circling." You course-correct before deals die, not after. For pitching, Shadow adapts to every buyer—technical details for the CIO, pure value for marketing leaders. It tracks competitive intel so you know how to position against whoever else is in the deal.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            On complex deals, you're orchestrating internally as much as selling externally. Shadow helps you activate the right internal stakeholders (product, legal, SEs, infosec, customer references) and tracks what's needed at each stage. The busywork—drafting follow-ups, pulling usage data, scheduling briefings, updating CRM notes, prepping QBRs—Shadow handles while you focus on closing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
            The result? You build pipeline consistently. You close deals predictably. You adapt your pitch to every buyer. And you orchestrate complex deals like the project manager you actually are.
